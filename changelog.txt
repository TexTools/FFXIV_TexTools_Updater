v3.0.5.0
+ BUGFIXES
   - Fixed issues with Windows Long Path support.  Long Path support should now work when upgrading penumbra Libraries with really really long file names.
   - Fixed a niche issue where modpack upgrades could fail when the modpack contained NULL groups/options.
   - Fixed an issue where the UI was unnecessarily reloading the current item on save.
   - Fixed issues where BG/Prop Models would not have their materials/textures loaded.
   
+ NEW
   - Added "View Model as Item" option under the View menu.  This will let you load arbitrary models (Ex. BG/Prop/Zone models) as a complete 'item', including their associated materials and textures.


v3.0.4.9
+ Dawntrail Upgrades
  - Fixed issues with DX9 Materials failing to convert in some cases.
    - This primarily affected old hair mods, particularly those with accessories.
  - Added Gear Mask Upgrade Menu
    - This tool is for converting standalone old Endwalker gear mask files to Dawntrail
  - Texture upgrade tools can now properly load .TEX files.
  - Texture upgrade tools can now properly save .PNG files.
  
+ OTHER
  - Minions/Mounts now have their hotbar icons accessible/editable.


v3.0.4.8
+ Dawntrail Upgrades:
  - Fixed a niche issue with CharacterGlass textures that had exactly full-white gloss masks.

+ Modpacking:
   - Empties are now not cleared on modpack creation, but instead on Modpack Import. (Mirrors Penumbra Behavior better, and safer)
   - Fixed an issue where pages/groups/options could be lost in the Advanced Modpack Creator if they were initially exported as Empty, then had data added after initially exporting them.

+ Bugfixes:
   - Fixed an issue where a corrupt item sets file could cause multiple failures across the application.
   - Fixed a Crash in the Penumbra Library Converter if a folder was deleted from the source library after starting.
