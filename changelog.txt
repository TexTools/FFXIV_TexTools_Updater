-- REQUIRES FFXIV v7.1 --
v3.0.9.1
+ MODEL IMPORTING
  - Better support for new 7.1 face modding, without introducing neck seams or lighting bugs
    - NOTE: You must import a model file over a vanilla 7.1 face -- not an already modded one -- in order to preserve neck data
      - There is no automatic upgrade process when importing a mod containing a pre-7.1 face model
      - To verify presence of neck data: More Actions > Show Raw MDL Info > Other Data > Neck Morph
      - Models containing Neck Morph data are only compatible with Dawntrail Patch 7.1 and later

+ BUGFIX
  - Fix "Edit Model" window crash on Chinese language
  - Fix "Restore Mod Backup" button always failing (and causing your entire transaction / mod to be deleted ...)

  - The Project File Tracker can lose track of files in some instances/setups.


-- REQUIRES FFXIV v7.0 --
v3.0.8.7
+ MINOR
  - Updated Item Sets
  - New selfsigned Sha256 signatures on Textools, Modding Framework and Installer files.

- BUGFIX
  - Quick hackfix to ensure new 7.1 face models don't trigger old broken mod model fixes. May need further review/testing with really old models
  - Recalculate mipmap offsets after regeneration
  - Fix forward slashes in long paths causing error
  - No inverting the normals!
  - Import the 'default option' from PMP files with multiple options
  - Fix Case sensitivity issue generating ExtraFiles list for PMPs


v3.0.8.6
+ MINOR
  - Updated Verbiage in the Colorset Editor to match Penumbra's Material editor on more fields.
  - Added additional catches to avoid crashing for various invalid states during application startup & when using the Penumbra Library converter.
  - Binormal Handedness is now correctly calculated when importing a model using existed Binormal/Tangent data in the FBX file, based on said imported Binormal/Tangent data.
  - Removed the {Variant} Token in the texture path tokenizer due to it largely just being confusing and sometimes adding the wrong variant ID.
  
- BUGFIX
  - Fixed .PMPs being incorrectly installed using the simple import dialog instead of the wizard importer in specific circumstances.


v3.0.8.5
+ MODELS
 - Fixed Binormal/Tangent data not being properly written to FBX files.
 - Fixed some niche quirks/seams with racial converting models.

+ MISC
 - Verbiage for the various Colorset Editor fields has been updated to match Penumbra's upcoming Material Editor updates.
   - In specific:
      Shader Effect ID => Sphere Map ID
	  Submaterial ID => Tile Map ID
   

v3.0.8.4
+ MODEL IMPORTING
  - Automatic SimpleHeels attribute calculation has been added.  This will automatically calculate and add SimpleHeels style heel offset attributes to foot/leg/body models that stick through the floor, based on their depth, to bring the character back to [0] offset.
  - This can be accessed/toggled via the import dialog and/or the model editor as needed.  Attributes are assigned to the first available part in the model.

+ MINOR
  - Multiple new/correct material Constant Names have been added (Thanks Ny)

+ BUGFIXES
  - Metallic maps are now exported correctly again for non-legacy items when exporting PBR textures.
  - Adjusted some error prompts to ensure they can't crash the application by being called from the wrong thread.


v3.0.8.3
+ BUGFIX
  - Fixed crash/export failures when exporting racially converted models.

+ MINOR
  - Changed "Penumbra Manipulations" to "Metadata Manipulations" in the advanced editor to better reflect their purpose.


v3.0.8.2
+ NEW
  - Added 'Regenerate Skeletons' button to the Settings.  This will rebuild the skeleton cache from the current system state, to ease the process of adding custom bone transformers.
  - Added 'Add Colorset' button on Materials that don't have colorsets.  I have no idea if the game will actually support or read colorsets on shaders that do not have them already, but now you can test and find out. (You will probably need to add an Index sampler/texture by hand)

+ BUGFIXES
  - Fixed HDR Color edit throwing an error when trying to save the colors.
  - Fixed some more niche install location errors.
  - Binormals/Tangents are now automatically recalculated after racial transforms to avoid weird transform bugs.
  
+ MISC
  - Updated Auto-Updater version and ImageSharp versions.


v3.0.8.1
+ DOUBLE CLICK IMPORT / MODPACK FILE HANDLING
 - The behavior for Double-click importing modpacks from windows has changed.
 - You will now be prompted with a small screen where you may choose from a number of new options:
   - Upgrade and Import to Penumbra:  This will automatically update the modpack and import the modpack directly into Penumbra.
   - Upgrade and Import to FFXIV (Unsafe): Updates and imports the file to TexTools/The FFXIV files system (previously default behavior)
   - Upgrade Modpack for Dawntrail: Upgrades the Modpack and prompts you for a location to save the result.
   - Shrink Modpack: Shrinks the Modpack and prompts you for a location to save the result.
   
+ UI
  - A new [Import Modpack to Penumbra] option has been added to the main Mods menu, which functions the same as above. (Upgrades a given Modpack and imports it to Penumbra)

+ BUGFIXES
  - TT will now correctly identify the user's quick-launcher attached FFXIV install on first time startup and set that as their default FFXIV install, if the quick launcher is installed.
  - Fixed some misc issues where TexTools could fail to startup properly due to corrupt or invalid settings.
  - Import only mode and the Console tool now use unique temporary folders per-run to prevent issues when performing simultaneous execution.


v3.0.8.0
+ MODEL IMPORTING
  - The Model Editor has been reorganized slightly.
  - You can now edit Vertex data globally, per-mesh, or per-part.
  - Vertex Data edit screen now has much more detail
  - Vertex Data edit screen now includes tools for managing Anisotropic Flow data for Hair
  - You can now edit the base level Model Flags, such as shadow casting and weather occlusion effects.
  - Some settings such as Clear Vertex Color/Alpha have been moved into the editor, as they typically should not be blindly applied to the entire model.
  - The model editor now has a confirmation prompt when closing via the [x] button to ensure it's clear that your changes will be cancelled.

+ HAIR / ANISOTROPIC FLOW DATA
  - Anisotropic Flow data for hair is now editable. This data is piped to Vertex Color 3 for FBX Import/Export
    - NOTE: This means this data is NOT visible/editable when exporting for 3DS Max, as Max cannot work with multiple vertex color channels.
  - This data controls the way specular highlights behave on hair.  In particular, when properly authored, it makes the specular/lighting highlights properly follow the flow of the hair.
  - The data is a tangent space flow map painted onto the Vertex Color 3 layer, however, for the sanity of everyone involved, TexTools also offers the ability to generate Flow data based on UV map layout in the Edit Vertex Data segment of the model editor.  This should allow you to generate proper flow map structure easily as long as your hair strands are oriented in a consistent direction.

+ MISC
  - The unknown skin shader key is now labeled as [EMISSIVE].

+ BUGFIXES
  - Fixed a crash bug in the Edit Manipulations menu when attempting to remove non-existent Manipulations
  - Fixed an error that could cause race conversions to fail.
  - Binormal/Tangent Calculations are now much more accurate to SE's Expectations/systems, and are now also MUCH faster.
    - In some cases, re-importing your old FBX's may remove persistent niche seams that you couldn't get rid of easily before.
  - Fixed a UI error in the Shader Key menu that could sometimes show invalid shader keys when swapping keys around.
  - Updated the Shader info database.
  - Removed extraneous info from the default Shader DB to help shrink application/download size.
  

v3.0.7.5
+ MINOR/BUGFIX
  - Fixed DDS BC7 Exports for Gimp
  - Model Attributes can now use hyphens(-)


v3.0.7.5
+ NEW
  - Added "Shrink Modpack" button in the advanced modpack creator.  This will repack and/or clean up many files in the modpack and optionally shrink the texture sizes based on your settings.
    - As part of this, models will be updated to v6 if they are not already, and their bounding box information will be reset to fit with Dawntrail requirements.
    
  - The 3D Colorset Square is now a sphere, and has proper UV Tiling settings to display the sub-materials more accurately.

+ BUGFIX
  - The Penumbra Library upgrade tool will no longer crash the application if one of the folders it was set to upgrade was deleted.
  

v3.0.7.4
+ BUGFIXES
  - Fixed model reading/importing for old Furniture models.

  - Fixed an issue where Hrothgar Tail variants were missing in the UI.


v3.0.7.3
+ MODEL/DAWNTRAIL UPGRADES
  - Fixed an issue where "Tangent" data was being written to MDLs, which apparently does not actually function as Tangent data (at least on Hair).
    - This caused hair models to become Shiny after being saved, or when upgrading old TTMP files for Dawntrail.
	  - (This bug did not apply to Penumbra Library or .PMP modpack upgrades)
  
  - Fixed models not properly exporting to FBX with Vertex Alpha1 data.
  - The Bounding Box updates from v3.0.7.2 are now applied to all Dawntrail upgrades as well when updating MDLs from v5 to v6.

+ MINOR
  - Made some more missing safe/unsafe mode errors friendlier.
  - Removed a slight MTRL Bitflag tweak that appears to no longer be valid in DT (but did nothing)
  - Fixed exported FBX Extra Skeleton always coming from base game files rather than Transaction state.
  - Minor fixes for some more niche cases of particularly weird TTMPs/PMPs failing to import.
  - Dawntrail upgrades are now disabled if TT is attached to an Endwalker install (rather than improperly upgrading).


v3.0.7.2
+ BUGFIXES
  - Models are now saved with smaller/more reasonable bounding boxes.  This should fix issues close-up characters being invisible in portraits, and monster model click-boxes being too large.
  - Xenos now renders correctly in the model viewer again.
  - Fixed loading and converting old TTMPs that have multiple copies of the same file in the same option.
  - Fixed Hrothgar Female Bibo model rendering.
  - Fixed Item Converter failing if the model referenced monster textures.


v3.0.7.1
+ NEW SETTINGS
  - Added setting for default Image Export format (DDS/TGA/PNG)
  - Added setting for default Modpack Export format (PMP/TTMP2)

+ IMAGES
  - To reflect TGA being a better export format than PNG for textures, TGA has been bumped above PNG in the format list when saving Textures.  (Sorry muscle memory friends)
  - BMPs now export without transparency, because BMP with transparency is a truly cursed format that should not exist.

+ BUGFIXES
  - Fixed skin resolver being broken.  (Caused various renderer/visual in TT errors, had no effect in game)
  - Fixed Vertex buffer math being wrong in some cases. (Could cause large models to fail to import when they should've succeeded)
  


v3.0.7.0
+ DAWNTRAIL UPDATES
  - Fixed an issue where hair mods could incorrectly have their DX9 hair textures converted instead of DX11 textures, when using the Upgrade Modpack or Penumbra Library Update functions.

+ MODELS
  - Model Racial Deformations now fully support deforming to/from NPC races.
  - The FMV Skeleton selection now includes NPC races.


v3.0.6.9
+ DAWNTRAIL UPGRADES
  - Fixed a configuration issue that was causing Penumbra Library Updates to not update partial hair/tail/tattoo mods.
    - (These mods worked fine via the individual modpack updater, but would be fully or partially skipped via the library tool) 


v3.0.6.8
+ MODEL IMPORT
  - Fixed an issue where vertex colors were lost on import if the model did not have UV3 data.
  - Added warning for full white vertex colors on specifically eyes.
  - (Previous missed patch note): Updated model import warnings

v3.0.6.7
+ MISC
 - The Colorset Square/3D Render has been fixed, and now properly shows dyes, tile materials, and a rough approximation of most colorset data.
 - Changed "Dye All Rows" to optionally dye by dye channel.

+ BUGFIXES
 - Fixed Multi-Layer DDS file reading.
 - Fixed racial convert on import having unpredictable results.

  - Penumbra Library Updates now allow you to opt out of file compression if you so choose.
  - You may now select Multiple modpacks at once from the modpack upgrader.
    - When upgrading multiple modpacks at once via this option, the finished modpack files will be saved to the default location. (Same place as the original modpack with _dt added onto the end of the file name)

+ BUGFIXES
  - Fixed MipMaps not being generated on textures in custom/unusual directories.

+ UI
  - Weapons and Accessories have now been split off from Gear into their own top level categories.

  - Fixed saved PMP group numbers starting at 0 in the json group names instead of 1.
  
+ DAWNTRAIL UPDATES
  - Au Ra tail diffuse textures are now automatically repathed.
  - Rolled back normal map repathing for body textures, as the format changed enough to make it problematic.
  
+ TEXTURES
  - Added -bc q flag to BC7 DDS Conversions to improve the conversion quality.
  
+ MODELS
  - The Model Importer will now error if the total vertex data size is past FFXIV's limits.
  - Models will now smartly remove unused vertex information and compress the vertex data types if necessary in order to try to fit large models into the vertex data size limits, when possible.

+ DAWNTRAIL UPDATES
  - Added automatic skin-repathing for diffuse and normal textures.
    - This should preserve custom body tattoos in almost all cases, and will *partially* preserve old scale mods.
