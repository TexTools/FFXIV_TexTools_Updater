v3.0.4.8
+ Dawntrail Upgrades:
  - Fixed a niche issue with CharacterGlass textures that had exactly full-white gloss masks.

+ Modpacking:
   - Empties are now not cleared on modpack creation, but instead on Modpack Import. (Mirrors Penumbra Behavior better, and safer)
   - Fixed an issue where pages/groups/options could be lost in the Advanced Modpack Creator if they were initially exported as Empty, then had data added after initially exporting them.

+ Bugfixes:
   - Fixed an issue where a corrupt item sets file could cause multiple failures across the application.
   - Fixed a Crash in the Penumbra Library Converter if a folder was deleted from the source library after starting.
