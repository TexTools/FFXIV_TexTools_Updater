v3.0.5.4
+ MATERIAL CREATION
  - The Unique Textures button has returned, now with proper automatic-unique texture paths for all material types.
  - The Shared Textures button has been removed as it was confusing and did not work properly/the way users expected in most cases.
  - When Loading Material Presets, "Texture Paths" and "Texture Settings" are now separated.  Paths are off by default.
  - The pre-loaded material presets have had their colorsets blanked out to appropriate defaults for their shader type.

+ MISC
  - Added extra handling to try to prevent TT getting locked from failing to delete Readonly files in its temp directory.
  - Extremely old UI textures which have MipMaps when they shouldn't are preserved rather than being forced to power-of-two sizes.
  - Fixed a few niche crash/hard-error with friendlier error messages.
  - Fixed an issue where using the 'Restore Defaults' button in the racial settings editor would fail.
   


v3.0.5.3
+ DAWNTRAIL UPGRADES
  - Fixed issues where Specular textures on gear were getting improperly altered.
  - Fixed issues where Specular textures on gear were not having the correct shader keys/samplers assigned
     + As usual, if you had a mod affected by these issues, it must be re-upgraded from the original Endwalker version.
  
+ OTHER
  - Fixed issues where Bust MaxY value for racial scaling was getting mangled in some situations
  - Fixed issue where the material's Colorset would be bashed strangely when changing ShaderPacks in the UI.


v3.0.5.2
+ DAWNTRAIL UPDATES
  - Updated Hair conversions to try to salvage a few niche cases.
  - In particular, Hair Mashups which contain materials but not textures should now be automatically converted properly to the new texture paths.
    - As usual, if you were affected by these, please re-run the original Endwalker modpack through the update tool again.
	
  - The Upgrade Modpack tool will now notify the user when the modpack did not need changes/was not actually changed.

+ BUGFIXES
  - Increased cache busy timeout to try to prevent cases of errors due to disk delay.


v3.0.5.1
+ DAWNTRAIL UPDATES
  - Heliosphere JSON files are now properly preserved during Penumbra library updates.
  - Dawntrail Updater now has better status displays, indicating when mods are unchanged (and providing some guidance on why)
  - Added more human-readable warnings/errors for some rare/unusual issues.
  - UI now better specifies that it will update fluffy-tails as well.

+ MODPACKING
  - Loading an FBX into the advanced modpack UI will now automatically scrub materials from 0-Vertex Mesh Groups to ensure they do not cause rendering errors.
  - TTMP files created via committing a transaction now have the correct internal modpack name.


v3.0.5.0
+ BUGFIXES
   - Fixed issues with Windows Long Path support.  Long Path support should now work when upgrading penumbra Libraries with really really long file names.
   - Fixed a niche issue where modpack upgrades could fail when the modpack contained NULL groups/options.
   - Fixed an issue where the UI was unnecessarily reloading the current item on save.
   - Fixed issues where BG/Prop Models would not have their materials/textures loaded.
   
+ NEW
   - Added "View Model as Item" option under the View menu.  This will let you load arbitrary models (Ex. BG/Prop/Zone models) as a complete 'item', including their associated materials and textures.


v3.0.4.9
+ Dawntrail Upgrades
  - Fixed issues with DX9 Materials failing to convert in some cases.
    - This primarily affected old hair mods, particularly those with accessories.
  - Added Gear Mask Upgrade Menu
    - This tool is for converting standalone old Endwalker gear mask files to Dawntrail
  - Texture upgrade tools can now properly load .TEX files.
  - Texture upgrade tools can now properly save .PNG files.
  
+ OTHER
  - Minions/Mounts now have their hotbar icons accessible/editable.


v3.0.4.8
+ Dawntrail Upgrades:
  - Fixed a niche issue with CharacterGlass textures that had exactly full-white gloss masks.

+ Modpacking:
   - Empties are now not cleared on modpack creation, but instead on Modpack Import. (Mirrors Penumbra Behavior better, and safer)
   - Fixed an issue where pages/groups/options could be lost in the Advanced Modpack Creator if they were initially exported as Empty, then had data added after initially exporting them.

+ Bugfixes:
   - Fixed an issue where a corrupt item sets file could cause multiple failures across the application.
   - Fixed a Crash in the Penumbra Library Converter if a folder was deleted from the source library after starting.
