      - To use, select the Magnifying Glass icon on either the texture or model viewing screens.
 
Minor improvements/changes:
  - TexTools now has proper loading screens when it's loading/working on things.
  - The ModList and Modpack view screens have had their displays updated with more & more correct data.

You can still do everything as normal in TexTools and FFXIV while it's working, just know that some data may be missing on the ModPack screens until it's done.
 
  + This will be the last major patch to include any DAE support.  DAE-based functionality will be removed next major patch.

	- This can be remedied by selecting the Left Ring manually in the Sets list in addition to the normal ring.
  - Certain offhand items do not display their textures/materials in the textures tab.
    - These items use their associated Main Hand item's textures/materials.
