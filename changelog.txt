General improvements/fixes:
- Fixed TexTools not properly cleaning up temporary files when importing a modpack
- TexTools now also backs up the 0a0000 indexes
- TexTools can now repair a broken modlist through Start Over/Check For Problems
- Added a progress indicator to the Start Over process to hopefully prevent users from cancelling midway
- TexTools settings are loaded earlier so that language and theme selection choices are retained between versions

- Replaced an expired Discord invite
Importer improvements:
